# ⛓️ FreeCodeCamps's Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course

This repository contains the code that I've implemented while studying blockchain and smart contract development using this great [FreeCodeCamps's Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course](https://youtu.be/M576WGiDBdQ) by Patrick Collins.  
Reference repository: https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-py

## Web3.py Simple Storage

This project was aimed to talk about [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) and teach how to use it to deploy and interact with a solidity smart contract in a [Infura.io](https://infura.io/) testnet blockchain.

## Brownie Simple Storage

In this project I've learned how to deploy and test a solidity smart contract using it [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) a python framework for developing and testing smart contracts that target Ethereum Virtual Machines.

## Brownie Fund Me

Here I've learned how to use [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) Oracles and Smart Contracts to get price feeds and mock them for local and testnet blockchains.

## SmartContract Lottery

In this lottery project, I've used a [Chainlink Random Number Generator Oracle](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-a-random-number/) to select a winner and learned about [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) useful contracts such as Ownable. Here I've also improved my unit and integration testing skills.

## ERC20 Brownie

This simple project aims to teach how to create a ERC20 token based on [OpenZeppelin's ERC20 contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20).

## AAVE Brownie

This project introduced me to the DeFi world with the [AAVE](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/) decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol. Here I've developed scripts that interact programmaticly with AAVE by converting, depositing, borrowing and repaying tokens.

## NFT Demo

Here I've built my first NFT using OpenZeppelin's ERC721 and some dog images. I've also had it listed on OpenSea testnet.

## Upgrades

I've been teached that we have several ways to upgrade Smart Contracts, including the suggested way using a Proxy contract. In this project I learned about delegateCalls, gotchas and patterns when using this approach.

## Full Stack Defi

In this final lesson, I've built a Full Stack Defi using React and Solidity, so I've learned how to use some libraries to connect a Metamask Wallet to a webpage and interact with smart contracts.
